                    <p>Are you healthy? What’s your greens and fruit count today? How about for the week? Do you maintain a healthy diet that includes ample exercise and sleep? Do you have a process to track this stuff on a daily basis? I didn’t.. so I made a spreadsheet tracker, and now i’m sharing it with you and the rest of the internets for free. </p>
                    <p>In this super long post, I’m sharing my Health Tracker Google Doc Template, the scoring logic, and some personal insights to help you live a healthier and well balanced life. This is far from perfect, but hopefully motivates someone to try it out for 30 days or take the template and improve the scoring system. </p>

                    <p>In 1994, Pizza Hut was the first website to offer online ordering of pizzas. They exclusively serviced Santa Cruz, California, but it marked the first time a website accepted online payments. E-commerce was born. </p>
                    <p>Fast forward 20 years and consumers no longer bat an eyelid placing their credit card details into a web browser to purchase products online. It&#39;s safe, secure, and so convenient. Year after year, we see hockey stick growth as consumers spend more money online than ever before. </p>

                    <p>I just watched an interesting Techcrunch video from Mark Goines and Semil Shaho on Small Business. For those that don&#39;t know, Goines had a long stint at Intuit and is a notorious angel within the smb vertical. Shaho manages Haywire, an early stage investment firm that works with mobile first startups.</p>
                    <p>In 2010, I first discovered this problem while working at Ziplocal. As Director of Social Commerce, I launched from inception to delivery, new digital products to 60k Small Businesses and 700 sales reps. They really lacked the tools to effectively manage and market their business. The main reason why i&#39;m working on <a href="htpp://promo.co">Promo</a>.</p>

                    <p>8 weeks ago I broke my left fibula in the second half of our last game of the season. I&#39;ve broke several bones playing soccer before, but this time was different. The injury itself wasn&#39;t that bad, a clean break and aircast for 6-8 weeks. My season was done, but all I could think about was how this injury was going to impact my startup. It was leading into a critical time for my startup. I really needed to hustle, signup my first customers, and begin fundraising.</p>

                    <p>It&#39;s really easy to set ambitious goals. Placing goal posts at the right distance and monitoring goal progress for each goal has been a big challenge for me. Where are your goal posts? Are you reeling them in, or setting them further back? Posting your public goals is fairly pompous, but sharing for social accountability. Some public goals for 2014:</p>

                    <p>With just under a month of use, here’s my take on the Nike Fuel Band. I was pretty skeptical when I first reviewed the Nike Fuel band. The flashing lights looked pretty spiffy but would this device drive me to my daily, weekly, and monthly goals? I was really apprehensive and skeptical about wearing a tracking…</p>

                    <p>Just a few months shy of the two year anniversary, i’ve decided to share my photographs and videos of the riots from my apartment. The actual event(s) that led up to the riot the are well documented. All photographs and videos were captured on my Canon S90 and iPhone 4. Most footage was recorded from my apartment located on the corner of Robson and Seymour Street. I had 15 friends over for the game and we literally had a skybox view of the looters, cars on fire, and riot squad. By the time things had really escalated we couldn’t step out onto the balcony as there was too much tear gas.</p>

                    <p>Paralysis. We’ve all experienced it when making important life, work, or financial decisions. Textbooks state time and information are key to making decisions, but Gerd Gigerenzer has some really interesting case studies that counter the “If only I had more information, time or statistics to make decisions..” argument so many people use and say on a regular basis. Watch the keynote presentation below.. very interesting indeed.</p>

                    <p>I was inspired by usethis.com and a few conversations with friends to write a post on tools, services, and applications that I use to help maximize productivity on a daily basis. My top 3 must have applications would include 1Password, Read Later, and Things. These three apps keep me grounded, focused, organized, and on task. Each app accomplishes a different goal but saves me 30-60 minutes of time per day..</p>
